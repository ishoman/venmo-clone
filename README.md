# Venmo Clone

#### _Clone of the Venmo homepage._

#### By _**Isaac Shoman**_

## Description

_This project is a clone of Venmo's homepage (https://venmo.com/) using React. The main focus is on the iphone/android images and adding interactivity to them in way that Venmo does not have (being able to like and store comments)._


## Component Tree

![alt text](componentTree)

I decided to add state to the WelcomeImages Component because eventually I will want a user to be able to click the android phone, enter text, and create new transaction objects. And WelcomeImages is the lowest common ancestor between the Iphone and Android components.
